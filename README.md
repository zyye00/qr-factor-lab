# CSI500 Factor Lab

A small, reproducible research project for CSI 500 cross-sectional factor
analysis. The current implementation can download the current CSI 500 universe,
stock OHLCV data, and benchmark OHLCV data to parquet files.

## Scope

This project will gradually build:

- CSI 500 universe and OHLCV data ingestion
- basic return and forward-return labels
- simple cross-sectional factors
- IC / Rank IC evaluation
- quantile portfolio backtests
- transaction-cost and robustness checks
- a final Markdown research report

## Project Layout

```text
config.yaml
pyproject.toml
src/quant/
tests/
```

## Data Download

Install the project in editable mode first:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Then run the installed CLI:

```bash
quant download-data
```

Outputs:

```text
data/raw/csi500_universe.parquet
data/processed/stock_panel.parquet
data/processed/benchmark_000905.parquet
```

## Preprocess

After downloading data, build the cleaned panel with basic returns:

```bash
quant preprocess-data
```

Output:

```text
data/processed/clean_panel.parquet
```

The cleaned panel removes duplicate `date` + `ticker` rows, rows with missing
or non-positive `close`, and rows with `volume <= 0`. It adds `ret_1d`,
`ret_5d`, and `ret_20d`.

## Checks

```bash
ruff check .
pytest
```

## CI

GitHub Actions runs the same checks on pushes and pull requests to `main`:

```bash
ruff check .
pytest
```

The CI does not download market data, so external data-source outages do not
block code checks.

## Notes

This project is intended for research and educational purposes only. It does
not constitute investment advice.

The first-stage implementation uses current CSI 500 constituents instead of
historical index membership. Therefore, the backtest may suffer from
survivorship bias.

The transaction cost model is simplified and does not fully capture market
impact, limit-up/limit-down constraints, or intraday liquidity.

Long-short portfolio results are used to evaluate factor ranking power. They do
not directly represent an executable A-share trading strategy due to
short-selling constraints.
